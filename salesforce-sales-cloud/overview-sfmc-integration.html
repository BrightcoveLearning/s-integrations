    <p>The Video Cloud integration with Salesforce Sales Cloud uses Brightcove's Audience Insights technology to provide data on the online interactions of your Salesforce Sales Cloud (SFMC) contacts with Video Cloud videos. The integration is set up as an SFMC publish integration for the Audience Insights system.</p>

    <p>Audience Insights generates daily data aggregated at the user level for both subscription-based accounts and accounts that do not require a subscription. For subscription-based accounts the user rolls up based on the subscriberId and customerId. For accounts without subscriptions, the customerId is inferred from the <code translate="No">views</code> object instead. These non-subscription accounts are sometimes referred to as TV Everywhere (TVE) accounts, or registered user accounts.</p>

    <p>These aggregated values are present on reports that can be generated manually via the Audience Insights scorecard, or automatically generated on a daily or weekly basis depending on your settings.</p>

    <p>The reports containing these values can then be published to your publish integrations, such as Salesforce. Publishing a report will update the values for the users in the report that align with users that are tracked in Salesforce. This process can be automated from the settings page.</p>

    <p>The end results is that the Contacts object in Salesforce will be updated.</p>

    <p>Publish integrations can only update users that exist in both systems. It will not create new contacts in Salesforce.</p>

      <p>The Salesforce integration identifies users by looking at their primary email (the Email field on the Contact object in Salesforce). That email is hashed, and if the hashed value matches any of the hashed emails stored for Audience Insights users, that contact can be updated.</p>
      
      <p>Users that do not have an email in Salesforce, or do not have an email hash in Audience Insights cannot be identified, and therefore cannot be updated.</p>
