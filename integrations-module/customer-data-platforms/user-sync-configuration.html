    <p>MAP and CRM systems are great at storing data about user behavior. They are generally less effective at analyzing that data and identifying patterns that you can act on. This is where Brightcove's Audience Insights technology can provide valuable insights into your data to help you make good business decisions.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of the kind of campaigns you might run based on the insights Brightcove provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lead Qualification</strong>: Set different Segment tags to build a Lead Score in your Marketing Platform. Qualify them and move them along the funnel.</li>
      <li><strong>Ideal Customer Persona (ICP)</strong>: Identify your ICP and create a segment that will report every viewer with similar behavior to run a targeted campaign. Identify viewer preferences, patterns, and engagement to cater to the specific cohort through targeted messaging and campaigns.</li>
      <li><strong>Content promotion</strong>: Engage a prospect that has watched a specific video with related content.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription Management</strong>: Identify different segments of customers to lead them through their subscription or upgrade journey. Examples of Subscription management campaigns based on Segments are: Engage trialist, Updated Onboarding Flow, Idle users, Annual Plan Upgrades, Scheduled Cancellation Win-backs, Lost Customer Win-backs.</li>
    </ul>
