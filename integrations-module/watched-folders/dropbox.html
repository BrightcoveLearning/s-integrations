    <p>Brightcove allows you to select a folder on the popular cloud storage platform Dropbox that we will automatically ingest videos from. Brightcove will monitor the folder, checking it about every 10 minutes, and automatically ingest new videos it finds using your default ingest profile.</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently, Brightcove will only ingest videos from the Dropbox folder. If items other than video files are put in the folder, Brightcove will try to ingest them and those ingests will fail. Everything in the folder will be ingested, so do not include any files that Brightcove should not have access to</li>
      <li>You need to create a folder specific to Brightcove only</li>

      <li>Once ingestion of a video has begun, it will finish even if the video is removed.</li>
